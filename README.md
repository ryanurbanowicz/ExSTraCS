# ExSTraCS

This implementation of ExSTraCS 2.0.2 was coded in python 2.7, and is the original code used in the ExSTraCS 2.0 publication.  This is the first algorithm to ever solve the 135-bit multiplexer problem directly.  

This posting is indended mostly for backup and reference to the original version used in that publication.  For users interested in better organized code, or an implementation updated for python 3.0, and further code updates/fixes, we refer users to the ExSTraCS_2.0 repository instead.
